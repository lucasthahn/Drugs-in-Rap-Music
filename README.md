## The Mythology Surrounding Drugs and Hip-Hop

*"Hip-hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years"*

—Geraldo Rivera

This sentiment, famously sampled in Kendrick Lamar’s 2017 smash-hit “DNA,” reflects a common refrain against hip-hop that exists not just in conservative spheres but permeates almost all of mainstream culture. Using this line of thinking, the disproportionate number of Black Americans incarcerated for drug-related offenses can be easily explained away as a symptom of the glorification of violence, partying, and drug use that rappers are pushing onto younger generations. Whenever a young artist dies from an overdose, this only reinforces the notion that hip-hop music and substance abuse are inextricably linked in the eyes of the media—they’re often painted as victims of the hard-partying lifestyle promoted by their own music.

What this fails to account for, however, are the very reasons that these themes are so commonly seen in rap music in the first place. Addiction rarely exists in a vacuum, and through a closer reading of works from artists who have been oft-vilified as promoting this dangerous lifestyle, we can begin to gleam a more comprehensive understanding of the complex sociopolitical circumstances that drive so many to seek out drugs an escape from the pressures of modern life.

In this mixtape, we present several works that speak to the causes—and repercussions—of substance abuse. Throughout these songs, the artists display extreme emotional vulnerability in documenting their own inner turmoil, from falling into cycles of addiction to combat feelings of depression or isolation, feeling like they’re about to crack under the pressure of life in the public sphere, or reckoning with a justice system that seems to designed to keep them incarcerated and dependent on drugs. Instead of dismissing this music outright as “peddling a toxic ideology,” we believe that engaging with these tracks at face-value shines light on real problems faced by millions, both in the United States and internationally.

## "Good News" - Mac Miller, *Circles* (2020)

[Lyrics](https://genius.com/Mac-miller-good-news-lyrics)

As the lead single for the posthumously released Circles, “Good News” was the public’s first window into the more acoustic, singer/songwriter-influenced aesthetic the Pittsburgh rapper was exploring before his untimely death in 2018. Throughout the track, Miller references his struggle with the deep existential dread that comes along with seemingly having achieved success beyond anyone’s wildest dreams, yet still being unsatisfied in life. Exhausted by the pressure of feeling obligated to supply a steady stream of “good news,” not even drugs are able to provide the respite he so desperately needs: “Why does everybody need me to stay? Oh, I hate the feeling when you’re high but you’re underneath the ceiling.” This “ceiling” represents the self-defeating feedback loop of addiction: both personal guilt over his own dissatisfaction and the external pressure to maintain appearances only push him deeper within his own head, isolating himself from others and inflaming his desire to use drugs as an escape. The production of the song mirrors this sentiment of success tinged with sadness, with whimsical guitars and a laid-back drum beat contrasted against Miller’s dry, almost defeated vocal delivery and melodramatic chordal swells resembling an orchestra. Especially when viewed in the context of Mac Miller’s death from a drug overdose, “Good News” paints a clear picture of the complex interplay between societal pressures, mental health, and drug addiction.

## "Righteous” - Juice WRLD, *Legends Never Die* (2020)

[Lyrics](https://genius.com/Juice-wrld-righteous-lyrics)

In his first posthumous single, Juice sings about his complex relationship with drugs, pointing out that his abusive indulgence could cost his life. The production on this track, with Juice’s reverberated voice complemented by an angelic, pristine backdrop, pays homage to his premature passing. The contrast between his morbid, grungy lyrics and the soft, pure soundscape, alludes to a seemingly innocent kid’s dark struggle with drugs. Juice was a 21-year-old who had been using drugs for almost half of his life. In the second verse, he sings, “We may die this evening; Coughing and wheezing, bleeding,” detailing a bleak outlook on his drug abuse; contextualized with his passing, it’s almost as if Juice saw the end coming, using music to write his own tragedy. But even though Juice was well aware of the negative effects of drugs, he still found them as a “medicine to fix all of the damage.” Drugs were his way of coping with the pain of existing. More specifically in “Righteous,” Juice opens up about his anxiety, referring to its overbearing nature and his inability to function while in an anxious state of mind. Using drugs wasn’t something he just did, it was a part of him, part of how he was able to live normally. To some, Juice’s drug usage and abuse in his music is a cautionary tale. But in the context of his first collaborative mixtape with Future and how Future was the one who first inspired Juice to try lean for the first time, we can begin to see in “Righteous” how a new generation of kids like Juice WRLD are being affected by the over-glorification of drug usage as a way of solving their problems.

## "XO Tour Llife3" - Lil Uzi Vert, *Luv is Rage 2* (2017)

[Lyrics](https://genius.com/Lil-uzi-vert-xo-tour-llif3-lyrics)

Rounding out his follow up album Luv is Rage 2, “XO Tour Llif3” became Lil Uzi Vert’s first top ten single. Emblematic of the futuristic sound of his albums, the song starts off with an echoy synth that slowly builds towards the punchy bass drum of the trap style. The majority of this song is representative of the trap genre as a whole. Lil Uzi Vert spends much of the track exposing the fakeness of his competitors and their attempts at initiating him and his success. However, the track also holds darker themes of the paradoxical feelings of numbness and pain. The chorus repeats “Push me to the edge, All my friends are dead” for its hook. Towards the end of the first verse, Lil Uzi Vert gives the listener a brief peek into his use of Xanax and its effect on him saying “Xanny, help the pain, yeah; Please, Xanny, make it go away; I’m committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me; All the pain, now I can’t feel it; I swear that it’s slowing me.” As the finisher to the entire album, “XO Tour Llif3” gives the listener a window into the experience of fame and fortune that not only celebrates but also necessitates drug use as a pillar of stability in the rapper lifestyle.

## “Meet Mr. NICEGUY” - $uicideboy$, *I Want to Die In New Orleans* (2018)

[Lyrics](https://genius.com/Uicideboy-meet-mr-niceguy-lyrics)

“Meet Mr. NICEGUY” is the 11th track off of the 2018 album, I Want to Die In New Orleans, by $uicideboy$. The group is made up of Ruby da Cherry and $crim, who constantly reference suicide, anxiety, drugs, and openly discuss their mental health throughout their music. The music features crisp snare drums, closed hi-hats, kicks, and 808’s, with their raspy and aggressive vocals piercing through. Though at times, their vocals sound rather soft and dejected. The overall idea of the track seems to be about the regret he feels for losing a loved one and the pain of being alone, as a result of his constant drug habits. “Where the fuck was I when this relationship dried?/ I was probably high to realize you left my side.” As a result of his drug habits, he loses a loved one and uses drugs to escape this pain, creating a vicious cycle. The lyrical content itself addresses drug addiction, mentioning the use of various drugs in order to cope with stress. It is evident that their use of drugs is a means of escape from the pain of being sober and confronting their problems - “Grow up all alone/ No fam, no home/ So I do drugs, just to numb up/ Yeah, I do drugs, when I wanna.” This theme of coping with loneliness by doing drugs can also be seen through the lyrics, “Pour my heart on the concrete.” From this, we can see that he has nobody to talk to, and that he is truly alone, only able to share his intimate thoughts with an inanimate object.

## "Better Off (Dying)" - Lil Peep, *Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1* (2017)

[Lyrics](https://genius.com/Lil-peep-better-off-dying-lyrics)

On this track in his debut studio album Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 1, Lil Peep straddles genres, combining the punk rock edge with the percussive trap sound. Starting off his music career on SoundCloud, Lil Peep is often compared to Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain. In “Better Off (Dying)”, the rock influences are clear immediately as the track starts. The high gain guitar provides the harmonic foundation for the song, and the lo-fi filter on Lil Peep’s voice provides the grunge texture reminiscent of 90’s / 00’s punk boy bands. Once the chorus starts out, Lil Peep’s trap and hip hop influences begin to show themselves with heavy bass drums and ripping 32nd-note hi hats. The lyrics of the song are relatively simple for a song of the rap genre, leaving raw emotion unfiltered by lyrical gymnastics and flashy punch lines. In this song, Lil Peep uncovers the ostentatious facade he puts on as a rapper, revealing the dark, emotional struggle to find the will to live. In an effort to assuage the burdens of his mental illnesses, Lil Peep turns to drugs and cocaine to forget about his strife. He self-medicates to numb himself to his feelings of futility. “Better Off (Dying)” provides intimate insight into the blurred lines between the extravagance of the rapper lifestyle and the dependence on that lifestyle to maintain a bearable existence.

## “Rollin’ Like a Stoner” - Vic Mensa, *The Autobiography* (2017)

[Lyrics](https://genius.com/Vic-mensa-rollin-like-a-stoner-lyrics)


The track starts off with Vic Mensa describing his relationship with drugs, implying that getting high is a means of escape, “Rollin' like a stoner, I don't care about everything.” This idea of soberness being pain can be seen as there are many examples within the lyrics that relate being sober to suffering, “Out of control, I forgot to take my medicine” and “Tried to be sober, that didn't work for me.” The only way he feels normal and can maintain a sense of control is through the use of drugs. The work references his drug addiction, and as nobody knows this problem, he feels alone. The loneliness aspect can be seen in the fact that he is struggling, yet nobody knows. He mentions some problems he has, such as memory issues and paranoia, which result from the drug usage - “Please excuse my memory/ Anti-social, get the fuck away from me.” The main theme behind the work seems to be the taboo subject of substance addiction. As he needs drugs in order to feel normal, this is a very personal subject that he cannot easily share with other people, making him feel alone. The lyric “I got a problem nobody knows” can be seen as Vic hiding this problem of only being able to function with drugs. He is very open with the listener in saying that he is not okay, and that he is struggling and in need of help. “They say "Vic are you okay"? Dude no way I don't even know no more.” The song drastically changes mood towards the end, as it is much darker. He mentions that he hears voices in his head leading him towards suicidal tendencies, showing the more vicious aspects of substance addiction.

## “Crack Rock” - Frank Ocean, *channel ORANGE* (2012)

[Lyrics](https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-crack-rock-lyrics)

In the ninth track of his debut album, Frank Ocean sings about someone who is struggling with drug addiction, describing their dark, barren lifestyle of smoking crack in abandoned homes and fiending to get their next fix—often at the cost of those around them. Ocean no doubt paints a bleak outlook on drug usage and its controlling nature. The melancholy piano melody, soft drums, and his signature slow, slurred lyrics add to the overall dream-like soundscape. But this continuity is cut by the harsh repetition of “crack rock,” like a drug addict coming down from their high. Towards the last part of the track, Ocean comments on the “War on Drugs,” saying that even though cops are part of the problem, they’re treated like martyrs, while Ocean’s “brothers” are left to die with no justice. Ocean argues that the drug problem is not a problem because they are inherently addictive and destructive but because of a corrupt system set up to oppress people of color. “Crack Rock” tells the story of how those who are affected the most by drugs, in the end, are left with nothing.

## "Prison and Pharmaceuticals" - Kassa Overall, *Go Get Ice Cream and Listen to Jazz* (2019)

[Lyrics](https://genius.com/Kassa-overall-prison-and-pharmaceuticals-lyrics)

Throughout this eclectic cut, drawing musical influences from 21st-century classical music, modern jazz, and rap, Overall describes the oppressive, dehumanizing nature of the prison-industrial complex in America, which has a direct role in trapping Black Americans in a relentless cycle of drug abuse, poverty, and incarceration. He raps, “Uncle Sam pimping right down to the cuticles / What’s the best stocks? Prison and pharmaceuticals.” Not only does the draconian prison system unfairly punish addicts who would be better served with aid and support, but it actively profits off of their suffering. And as a college-educated man, Overall sees himself as an outsider within a system that would rather have him locked in a jail cell and “back on the Prozac.” Black Americans, he argues, face an impossible double standard - if society actively profits from your incarceration and attempts to secure an education are viewed as “provoking,” what recourse do you have? A dystopian sonic landscape drives this message home; atonal cello lines and dissonant, flowing piano chords combine with heavily-altered vocals to lend the track a disjointed, unsettling demeanor.
